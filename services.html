    <h3>Big Data ETL Processes</h3>

    <p>The value of today&#39;s business is data.  If you have a website, manufacturing process, internal process, inventory, or anything thing else that is business related it probably has some form of business relevant data.  Unless you have worked with a person who specializes in Big Data, then it is probably sitting in a fragmented state which is not adding any value to your business.</p>

    <p>A Big Data ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process will take any fragmented data you have and flow it into software that can help you generate reports, analyze trends, and get a better measurement of what your business is doing.  Get control of your data and implement a plan to cut the fluff from your bottom line!</p>

    <h3>System Automation</h3>

    <p>Do you pay an employee to click the same button every week for the sake of button clicking?  Do you or your employees parse through the same bits of information every day?  Do you manually run backups of your data or manage backup media manually?  Rename lots of files one by one?  We can take care of all of these scenarios and more.  Stop making more work for yourself and let us help you automate a process you do on a regular basis!</p>

    <h3>PHP Site Optimizations</h3>

    <h4>Multi-threaded Processing</h4>

    <p>Many smaller development shops will create custom software that looks good and works great when it is initially implemented.  Over time your software will start to slow down its background processing.  This is because the developers cut corners and implemented a single threaded processing architecture that will not fully utilize the underlying hardware architecture.</p>

    <h4>Caching Services</h4>

    <p>There are simple ways to improve your website.  Many sites on the internet are not set up properly to utilize many modern caching technologies and new hardware is not the answer.  Turn on HTTP caching headers.  Start using a CDN.  Build some caching directly into the app to reduce the number of times complex processes run!  Utilize these technologies to make sure your website stays running for a long time on the infrastructure you already have!</p>

    <h3>High Availability Web Applications</h3>

    <p>Simple brochure websites need not apply here.  If your site is starting to grow, if youâ€™re worried about outages, or if your business relies so heavily on your website that you lose money when it is down then your website is a High Availability Web Application (HAWA).  A HAWA will need to balance the load across many servers, create data redundancies, implement industry standard technologies to ensure uptime, and define standards around the development process to ensure that you have 99.9% uptime for your application.   </p>

    <h3>Web API Integrations</h3>

    <p>Need Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Linkedin, HipChat, or any of the other fine services integrated into your PHP application?  We have experience with all of these APIs and we can connect you to them.  Get the data you need, or push the information you want others to see. </p>
